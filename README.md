## How to edit/What to install

#### Programming languages/libraries
* node (version >= 10.*)
* npm (comes with node, version >= 6.4.*)

Everything else can be installed by running `npm install` in the relevant directory :)

#### Text editors:

Technically any text editor is fine. To make your life easy though, I **HIGHLY** recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Install the extensions:
* [TsLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin)
* [Node Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.node-debug2) *Optional*

## Layout

There's two directories here:

#### frontend

This is the client side code. Everything that makes up the webpage you see is here (React, HTML, CSS, etc.).

#### backend

This is the server side code. Everything that runs on the backend is here (Node.js, etc.)
